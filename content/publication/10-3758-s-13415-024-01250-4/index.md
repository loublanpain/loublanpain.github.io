abstract: Amygdala activation by emotional arousal during memory formation can prioritize
  events for long-term memory. Building upon our prior demonstration that brief electrical
  stimulation to the human amygdala reliably improved long-term recognition memory
  for images of neutral objects without eliciting an emotional response, our study
  aims to explore and describe individual differences and stimulation-related factors
  in amygdala-mediated memory modulation. Thirty-one patients undergoing intracranial
  monitoring for intractable epilepsy were shown neutral object images paired with
  direct amygdala stimulation during encoding with recognition memory tested immediately
  and one day later. Adding to our prior sample, we found an overall memory enhancement
  effect without subjective emotional arousal at the one-day delay, but not at the
  immediate delay, for previously stimulated objects compared to not stimulated objects.
  Importantly, we observed a larger variation in performance across this larger sample
  than our initial sample, including some participants who showed a memory impairment
  for stimulated objects. Of the explored individual differences, the factor that
  most accounted for variability in memory modulation was each participantâ€™s pre-operative
  memory performance. Worse memory performance on standardized neuropsychological
  tests was associated with a stronger susceptibility to memory modulation in a positive
  or negative direction. Sex differences and the frequency of interictal epileptiform
  discharges (IEDs) during testing also accounted for some variance in amygdala-mediated
  memory modulation. Given the potential and challenges of this memory modulation
  approach, we discuss additional individual and stimulation factors that we hope
  will differentiate between memory enhancement and impairment to further optimize
  the potential of amygdala-mediated memory enhancement for therapeutic interventions.
