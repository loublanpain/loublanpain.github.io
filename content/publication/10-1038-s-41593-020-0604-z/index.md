abstract: Specific cell populations may have unique contributions to schizophrenia
  but may be missed in studies of homogenate tissue. Here laser capture microdissection
  followed by RNA sequencing (LCM-seq) was used to transcriptomically profile the
  granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG-GCL) in human hippocampus and contrast
  these data to those obtained from bulk hippocampal homogenate. We identified widespread
  cell-type-enriched aging and genetic effects in the DG-GCL that were either absent
  or directionally discordant in bulk hippocampus data. Of the ~9 million expression
  quantitative trait loci identified in the DG-GCL, 15% were not detected in bulk
  hippocampus, including 15 schizophrenia risk variants. We created transcriptome-wide
  association study genetic weights from the DG-GCL, which identified many schizophrenia-associated
  genetic signals not found in transcriptome-wide association studies from bulk hippocampus,
  including GRM3 and CACNA1C. These results highlight the improved biological resolution
  provided by targeted sampling strategies like LCM and complement homogenate and
  single-nucleus approaches in human brain. Jaffe et al. profile the granule cell
  layer of the human hippocampus and find unique molecular associations for aging
  and genetic variation, as well as diagnosis with schizophrenia and its genetic risk,
  that were previously undiscovered in homogenate tissue.
