abstract: Neural responses to pulses of electrical stimulation, termed “evoked potentials”,
  can map brain connectivity and optimize deep brain stimulation as used in the treatment
  of neurological disease. As human neurotechnology now allows for simultaneous real-time
  sensing and stimulation at multiple channels throughout the brain, it will benefit
  from automated real-time detection of evoked potentials to prospectively guide brain
  stimulation targeting. Here we used intracranial brain stimulation data collected
  from 22 epilepsy patients undergoing seizure monitoring to design and evaluate an
  automated strategy for detecting evoked potentials produced by electrical brain
  stimulation. We evaluate and demonstrate the utility of two features - a high-frequency
  broadband power ratio, and cross-correlation across repeated stimulation trials
  - in detecting evoked potentials, showing that cross-correlation is a robust feature
  that can achieve 93% detection accuracy alone. We also show that combining these
  complementary features into a single metric improves detection performance over
  single features, and we present a complementary strategy for stimulation artifact
  rejection that improves detection performance of all features. In conclusion, we
  present an automated strategy for detecting evoked potentials that can be applied
  to large-scale brain data and used online to optimize brain stimulation targeting
  in applications such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and more.
