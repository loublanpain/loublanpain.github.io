abstract: Modulating brain oscillations has strong therapeutic potential. Interventions
  that both non-invasively modulate deep brain structures and are practical for chronic
  daily home use are desirable for a variety of therapeutic applications. Repetitive
  audio-visual stimulation, or sensory flicker, is an accessible approach that modulates
  hippocampus in mice, but its effects in humans are poorly defined. We therefore
  quantified the neurophysiological effects of flicker with high spatiotemporal resolution
  in patients with focal epilepsy who underwent intracranial seizure monitoring. In
  this interventional trial (NCT04188834) with a cross-over design, subjects underwent
  different frequencies of flicker stimulation in the same recording session with
  the effect of sensory flicker exposure on local field potential (LFP) power and
  interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) as primary and secondary outcomes, respectively.
  Flicker focally modulated local field potentials in expected canonical sensory cortices
  but also in the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex, likely via resonance
  of stimulated long-range circuits. Moreover, flicker decreased interictal epileptiform
  discharges, a pathological biomarker of epilepsy and degenerative diseases, most
  strongly in regions where potentials were flicker-modulated, especially the visual
  cortex and medial temporal lobe. This trial met the scientific goal and is now closed.
  Our findings reveal how multi-sensory stimulation may modulate cortical structures
  to mitigate pathological activity in humans. Repetitive audio-visual stimulation,
  or sensory flicker, can modulate oscillations in a non-invasive manner. Here the
  authors demonstrate the potential of flicker in individuals with epilepsy undergoing
  intracranial seizure monitoring.
