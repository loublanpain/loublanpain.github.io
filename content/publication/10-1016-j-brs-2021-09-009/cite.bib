 abstract = {Background Direct electrical stimulation of the amygdala can enhance declarative memory for specific events. An unanswered question is what underlying neurophysiological changes are induced by amygdala stimulation. Objective To leverage interpretable machine learning to identify the neurophysiological processes underlying amygdala-mediated memory, and to develop more efficient neuromodulation technologies. Method Patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy and depth electrodes placed in the hippocampus and amygdala performed a recognition memory task for neutral images of objects. During the encoding phase, 160 images were shown to patients. Half of the images were followed by brief low-amplitude amygdala stimulation. For local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from key medial temporal lobe structures, feature vectors were calculated by taking the average spectral power in canonical frequency bands, before and after stimulation, to train a logistic regression classification model with elastic net regularization to differentiate brain states. Results Classifying the neural states at the time of encoding based on images subsequently remembered versus not-remembered showed that theta and slow-gamma power in the hippocampus were the most important features predicting subsequent memory performance. Classifying the post-image neural states at the time of encoding based on stimulated versus unstimulated trials showed that amygdala stimulation led to increased gamma power in the hippocampus. Conclusion Amygdala stimulation induced pro-memory states in the hippocampus to enhance subsequent memory performance. Interpretable machine learning provides an effective tool for investigating the neurophysiological effects of brain stimulation.},
