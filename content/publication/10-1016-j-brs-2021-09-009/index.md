abstract: Background Direct electrical stimulation of the amygdala can enhance declarative
  memory for specific events. An unanswered question is what underlying neurophysiological
  changes are induced by amygdala stimulation. Objective To leverage interpretable
  machine learning to identify the neurophysiological processes underlying amygdala-mediated
  memory, and to develop more efficient neuromodulation technologies. Method Patients
  with treatment-resistant epilepsy and depth electrodes placed in the hippocampus
  and amygdala performed a recognition memory task for neutral images of objects.
  During the encoding phase, 160 images were shown to patients. Half of the images
  were followed by brief low-amplitude amygdala stimulation. For local field potentials
  (LFPs) recorded from key medial temporal lobe structures, feature vectors were calculated
  by taking the average spectral power in canonical frequency bands, before and after
  stimulation, to train a logistic regression classification model with elastic net
  regularization to differentiate brain states. Results Classifying the neural states
  at the time of encoding based on images subsequently remembered versus not-remembered
  showed that theta and slow-gamma power in the hippocampus were the most important
  features predicting subsequent memory performance. Classifying the post-image neural
  states at the time of encoding based on stimulated versus unstimulated trials showed
  that amygdala stimulation led to increased gamma power in the hippocampus. Conclusion
  Amygdala stimulation induced pro-memory states in the hippocampus to enhance subsequent
  memory performance. Interpretable machine learning provides an effective tool for
  investigating the neurophysiological effects of brain stimulation.
