abstract: Rhythmic neural activity, which coordinates brain regions and neurons to
  achieve multiple brain functions, is impaired in many diseases. Despite the therapeutic
  potential of driving brain rhythms, methods to noninvasively target deep brain regions
  are limited. Accordingly, we recently introduced a noninvasive stimulation approach
  using flickering lights and sounds (“flicker”). Flicker drives rhythmic activity
  in deep and superficial brain regions. Gamma flicker spurs immune function, clears
  pathogens, and rescues memory performance in mice with amyloid pathology. Here,
  we present substantial improvements to this approach that is flexible, user-friendly,
  and generalizable across multiple experimental settings and species. We present
  novel open-source methods for flicker stimulation across rodents and humans. We
  demonstrate rapid, cross-species induction of rhythmic activity without behavioral
  confounds in multiple settings from electrophysiology to neuroimaging. This flicker
  approach provides an exceptional opportunity to discover the therapeutic effects
  of brain rhythms across scales and species.
