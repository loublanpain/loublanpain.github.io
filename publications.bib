abstract = {{Modulating brain oscillations has strong therapeutic potential. Interventions that both non-invasively modulate deep brain structures and are practical for chronic daily home use are desirable for a variety of therapeutic applications. Repetitive audio-visual stimulation, or sensory flicker, is an accessible approach that modulates hippocampus in mice, but its effects in humans are poorly defined. We therefore quantified the neurophysiological effects of flicker with high spatiotemporal resolution in patients with focal epilepsy who underwent intracranial seizure monitoring. In this interventional trial (NCT04188834) with a cross-over design, subjects underwent different frequencies of flicker stimulation in the same recording session with the effect of sensory flicker exposure on local field potential (LFP) power and interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) as primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. Flicker focally modulated local field potentials in expected canonical sensory cortices but also in the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex, likely via resonance of stimulated long-range circuits. Moreover, flicker decreased interictal epileptiform discharges, a pathological biomarker of epilepsy and degenerative diseases, most strongly in regions where potentials were flicker-modulated, especially the visual cortex and medial temporal lobe. This trial met the scientific goal and is now closed. Our findings reveal how multi-sensory stimulation may modulate cortical structures to mitigate pathological activity in humans. Repetitive audio-visual stimulation, or sensory flicker, can modulate oscillations in a non-invasive manner. Here the authors demonstrate the potential of flicker in individuals with epilepsy undergoing intracranial seizure monitoring.}},

abstract = {{Background Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1, narcolepsy with cataplexy) is a disabling neurological disorder caused by loss of excitatory orexin neurons from the hypothalamus and is characterized by decreased motivation, sleep-wake fragmentation, intrusion of rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS) during wake, and abrupt loss of muscle tone, called cataplexy, in response to sudden emotions. Objective We investigated whether subcortical stimulation, analogous to clinical deep brain stimulation (DBS), would ameliorate NT1 using a validated transgenic mouse model with postnatal orexin neuron degeneration. Methods Using implanted electrodes in freely behaving mice, the immediate and prolonged effects of DBS were determined upon behavior using continuous video-electroencephalogram-electromyogram (video/EEG/EMG) and locomotor activity, and neural activation in brain sections, using immunohistochemical labeling of the immediate early gene product c-Fos. Results Brief 10-s stimulation to the region of the lateral hypothalamus and zona incerta (LH/ZI) dose-responsively reversed established sleep and cataplexy episodes without negative sequelae. Continuous 3-h stimulation increased ambulation, improved sleep-wake consolidation, and ameliorated cataplexy. Brain c-Fos from mice sacrificed after 90 min of DBS revealed dose-responsive neural activation within wake-active nuclei of the basal forebrain, hypothalamus, thalamus, and ventral midbrain. Conclusion Acute and continuous LH/ZI DBS enhanced behavioral state control in a mouse model of NT1, supporting the feasibility of clinical DBS for NT1 and other sleep-wake disorders.}},

Despite the therapeutic potential of driving brain rhythms, methods to noninvasively target deep brain regions are limited. Accordingly, we recently introduced a noninvasive stimulation approach using flickering lights and sounds (“flicker”). Flicker drives rhythmic activity in deep and superficial brain regions. Gamma flicker spurs immune function, clears pathogens, and rescues memory performance in mice with amyloid pathology. Here, we present substantial improvements to this approach that is flexible, user-friendly, and generalizable across multiple experimental settings and species. We present novel open-source methods for flicker stimulation across rodents and humans. We demonstrate rapid, cross-species induction of rhythmic activity without behavioral confounds in multiple settings from electrophysiology to neuroimaging. This flicker approach provides an exceptional opportunity to discover the therapeutic effects of brain rhythms across scales and species.}},

An unanswered question is what underlying neurophysiological changes are induced by amygdala stimulation. Objective To leverage interpretable machine learning to identify the neurophysiological processes underlying amygdala-mediated memory, and to develop more efficient neuromodulation technologies. Method Patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy and depth electrodes placed in the hippocampus and amygdala performed a recognition memory task for neutral images of objects. During the encoding phase, 160 images were shown to patients. Half of the images were followed by brief low-amplitude amygdala stimulation. For local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from key medial temporal lobe structures, feature vectors were calculated by taking the average spectral power in canonical frequency bands, before and after stimulation, to train a logistic regression classification model with elastic net regularization to differentiate brain states. Results Classifying the neural states at the time of encoding based on images subsequently remembered versus not-remembered showed that theta and slow-gamma power in the hippocampus were the most important features predicting subsequent memory performance. Classifying the post-image neural states at the time of encoding based on stimulated versus unstimulated trials showed that amygdala stimulation led to increased gamma power in the hippocampus. Conclusion Amygdala stimulation induced pro-memory states in the hippocampus to enhance subsequent memory performance. Interpretable machine learning provides an effective tool for investigating the neurophysiological effects of brain stimulation.}},

abstract = {{Reconstructing genome history is complex but necessary to reveal quantitative principles governing genome evolution. Such reconstruction requires recapitulating into a single evolutionary framework the evolution of genome architecture and gene repertoire. Here, we reconstructed the genome history of the genus Lachancea that appeared to cover a continuous evolutionary range from closely related to more diverged yeast species. Our approach integrated the generation of a high-quality genome data set; the development of AnChro, a new algorithm for reconstructing ancestral genome architecture; and a comprehensive analysis of gene repertoire evolution. We found that the ancestral genome of the genus Lachancea contained eight chromosomes and about 5173 protein-coding genes. Moreover, we characterized 24 horizontal gene transfers and 159 putative gene creation events that punctuated species diversification. We retraced all chromosomal rearrangements, including gene losses, gene duplications, chromosomal inversions and translocations at single gene resolution. Gene duplications outnumbered losses and balanced rearrangements with 1503, 929, and 423 events, respectively. Gene content variations between extant species are mainly driven by differential gene losses, while gene duplications remained globally constant in all lineages. Remarkably, we discovered that balanced chromosomal rearrangements could be responsible for up to 14\% of all gene losses by disrupting genes at their breakpoints. Finally, we found that nonsynonymous substitutions reached fixation at a coordinated pace with chromosomal inversions, translocations, and duplications, but not deletions. Overall, we provide a granular view of genome evolution within an entire eukaryotic genus, linking gene content, chromosome rearrangements, and protein divergence into a single evolutionary framework.}},

Here laser capture microdissection followed by RNA sequencing (LCM-seq) was used to transcriptomically profile the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG-GCL) in human hippocampus and contrast these data to those obtained from bulk hippocampal homogenate. We identified widespread cell-type-enriched aging and genetic effects in the DG-GCL that were either absent or directionally discordant in bulk hippocampus data. Of the \textbackslashtextasciitilde9 million expression quantitative trait loci identified in the DG-GCL, 15\% were not detected in bulk hippocampus, including 15 schizophrenia risk variants. We created transcriptome-wide association study genetic weights from the DG-GCL, which identified many schizophrenia-associated genetic signals not found in transcriptome-wide association studies from bulk hippocampus, including GRM3 and CACNA1C. These results highlight the improved biological resolution provided by targeted sampling strategies like LCM and complement homogenate and single-nucleus approaches in human brain.

As human neurotechnology now allows for simultaneous real-time sensing and stimulation at multiple channels throughout the brain, it will benefit from automated real-time detection of evoked potentials to prospectively guide brain stimulation targeting. Here we used intracranial brain stimulation data collected from 22 epilepsy patients undergoing seizure monitoring to design and evaluate an automated strategy for detecting evoked potentials produced by electrical brain stimulation. We evaluate and demonstrate the utility of two features - a high-frequency broadband power ratio, and cross-correlation across repeated stimulation trials - in detecting evoked potentials, showing that cross-correlation is a robust feature that can achieve 93\% detection accuracy alone. We also show that combining these complementary features into a single metric improves detection performance over single features, and we present a complementary strategy for stimulation artifact rejection that improves detection performance of all features. In conclusion, we present an automated strategy for detecting evoked potentials that can be applied to large-scale brain data and used online to optimize brain stimulation targeting in applications such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and more.}},

Building upon our prior demonstration that brief electrical stimulation to the human amygdala reliably improved long-term recognition memory for images of neutral objects without eliciting an emotional response, our study aims to explore and describe individual differences and stimulation-related factors in amygdala-mediated memory modulation. Thirty-one patients undergoing intracranial monitoring for intractable epilepsy were shown neutral object images paired with direct amygdala stimulation during encoding with recognition memory tested immediately and one day later. Adding to our prior sample, we found an overall memory enhancement effect without subjective emotional arousal at the one-day delay, but not at the immediate delay, for previously stimulated objects compared to not stimulated objects. Importantly, we observed a larger variation in performance across this larger sample than our initial sample, including some participants who showed a memory impairment for stimulated objects. Of the explored individual differences, the factor that most accounted for variability in memory modulation was each participant’s pre-operative memory performance. Worse memory performance on standardized neuropsychological tests was associated with a stronger susceptibility to memory modulation in a positive or negative direction. Sex differences and the frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) during testing also accounted for some variance in amygdala-mediated memory modulation. Given the potential and challenges of this memory modulation approach, we discuss additional individual and stimulation factors that we hope will differentiate between memory enhancement and impairment to further optimize the potential of amygdala-mediated memory enhancement for therapeutic interventions.}},
